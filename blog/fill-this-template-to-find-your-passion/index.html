  <article class="post-content">
    <p>Finding passion is one of the most important and the most difficult things in our lives. I’ve been struggling for a long time trying to find out where my passion lies. Recently, because my job hunting is starting, I’m really into thinking about it.</p>

<p>Today, I want to share you 1 tool to help you find your passion. However, I think there is no silver bullet to find our passion, and we have to think from many aspects. I just hope this tool helps you take a step forward in the journey of your self discovery.</p>

    tl;dr
  </h2>

  <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
    <p>
      For busy guys, here&#8217;s the thing:
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;In my ideal world, &#x2026;&#8221;
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

  <h2 id="sec-2">
    Why Template?
  </h2>

  <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
    <p>
      Templates are good because it&#8217;s immediately actionable. One of my favorite is the <a href="http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/advantages-of-the-as-a-user-i-want-user-story-template" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com']);">user story template</a> (&#8220;As a &lt;type of user&gt;, I want &lt;some goal&gt; so that &lt;some reason&gt;&#8221;). Filling this out gives me a great first momentum of starting user-centered service designing.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are many articles on the Internet (e.g. &#8220;N Ways to Find Your Passion&#8221;) trying to help us find our passion. However, I think most of those ideas are too abstract and rarely immediately actionable. So, I came up with a template which I can fill out right away.
    </p>
  </div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-3" class="outline-2">
  <h2 id="sec-3">
    The Template for Finding your Passion
  </h2>

  <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
    <p>
      Here&#8217;s the template:
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;In my ideal world, &#x2026;&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      By finishing this sentence, you will get a vague idea what you want to do with your life. Because your ideal world is, well, your ideal world, you are most likely to be passionate to actualize such a world.
    </p>

    <p>
      A good thing about this template is that this doesn&#8217;t limit anything about your idea. So you can be virtuous like &#8220;In my ideal world, there is no child suffering from starvation&#8221;, or you can be selfish like &#8220;In my ideal world, I&#8217;m the richest person in the world.&#8221; Try out some variations and find the most strong sentence that hits your heart.
    </p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-4" class="outline-2">
  <h2 id="sec-4">
    Examples
  </h2>

  <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
    <p>
      I&#8217;ve tried it myself and came up with following sentences:
    </p>

    <ul class="org-ul">
      <li>
        In my ideal world, I&#8217;m super productive and I can do anything better than any man.
      </li>
      <li>
        In my ideal world, I&#8217;m improving myself constantly at the speed of light.
      </li>
      <li>
        In my ideal world, people are doing only creative things and not any barbaric stuffs (like tax).
      </li>
      <li>
        In my ideal world, people are doing what they love 100% of their time.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      I got fond of the last one because the reason I&#8217;m into productivity stuffs is to use more time to do what I love. And I found I was happy when I saved other people&#8217;s time and made them focus on what they truly wanted to do. So, it might be a good decision for me to devote my life to actualize the world where people can do what they love 100% of their time.
    </p>
  </div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-5" class="outline-2">
  <h2 id="sec-5">
    What&#8217;s Next?
  </h2>

  <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
    <p>
      To be honest, I&#8217;m not sure. I&#8217;m not planning to stop thinking here, so I will continue revising this sentence and thinking with other methods. If you are confident that you have firm, unchangeable value in you, I suggest you to write a &#8220;personal mission statement&#8221;, which is introduced in the infamous book &#8220;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Habits-Highly-Effective-People-Powerful/dp/1451639619/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.amazon.com']);">The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</a>&#8220;.
